<h3>Server Details:</h3>
<p><strong>Arcadia Survival</strong> was generated in Minecraft version 1.20.1 and released for beta trials on January 19th 2024 and opened for full release January 22nd 2024.</p>
<p>Arcadia is a player based economy designed to keep players active and involved.  Without the ability for players to use /shop it encourages players to interact with eachother and build their own shops for players to buy from, but if those players do not stay active it will leave the door open for another player or players to create a shop of their own and start selling what the other player used to corner the market with!  After a set amount of Playtime all players will unlock the ability to set their own shop warp, regardless of rank.</p>
<p><strong>Arcadia Survival</strong> has custom textures and mobs, the server resource pack is <u>NOT</u> required but is <strong>strongly</strong> suggested to be used in order to see custom crates, models and textures.  <i>The server resource pack does <u>NOT</u> change anything within the players own resource pack, it only enhances and adds the custom items and models</i>.</p>
